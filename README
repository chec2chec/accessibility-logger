# Accessibility Logger

A Chrome DevTools extension that helps developers understand and debug accessibility issues from a screen reader user's perspective. Inspired by NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) screen reader functionality.

## 🎯 Purpose

This extension bridges the gap between developers and screen reader users by providing real-time accessibility event monitoring and NVDA-like navigation simulation. It helps developers:

- **Debug accessibility issues** before they impact real users
- **Understand screen reader interaction patterns** 
- **Test ARIA implementations** and focus management
- **Optimize keyboard navigation** for assistive technology users
- **Identify missing accessibility markup** in real-time

## ✨ Current Features

- **Real-time Event Logging**: Focus changes, ARIA updates, keyboard interactions, live region announcements
- **NVDA-inspired Navigation**: Tab, Shift+Tab, Arrow keys, Enter, Escape navigation within the logger
- **DevTools Integration**: Native Chrome DevTools panel for seamless development workflow
- **Event Management**: Toggle logging, clear logs, export data for analysis
- **Detailed Event Information**: Comprehensive element data including roles, labels, attributes
- **Accessible Interface**: The logger itself follows accessibility best practices

## 🔮 Next Phase: Audio Feedback

The upcoming major enhancement will add **text-to-speech capabilities** to simulate the complete NVDA experience:

- 🔊 **Read-aloud functionality** for accessibility events and announcements
- 🔇 **Toggle sound on/off** option for silent debugging or full audio simulation  
- ⚙️ **Speech controls** for rate and voice preferences
- 📢 **Audio announcements** for navigation state changes

This will transform the extension into a complete screen reader simulation environment.
